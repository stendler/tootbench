  abstract: >
    The rising popularity and growing user base of
    the Fediverse and Mastodon in particular, begs the question
    regarding the impact of federation on participating instances.
    This report details the technical implementation, execution and
    result evaluation of a benchmark of the overhead of Mastodons
    federation. Mastodon was deployed in production mode using
    Docker on multiple Compute Engine VMs on the Google Cloud
    Platform.
    Scenarios with varying number of instances and users are
    evaluated regarding CPU utilization per instance, global CPU
    utilization and latency of published messages distributed from
    the server to the recipients. The global CPU utilization was the
    same for a varying number of federating instances and the same
    amount of global users. But individual instances can be relieved
    when users are distributed among them. A significant 4 to 10
    times higher latency of message distribution was measured due
    to federation, which is still deemed to be acceptable for the human
    users of this kind of application.
